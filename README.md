# TextureBot
TextureBot is an AI assistant that helps 3D artists find suitable textures using natural language. It does not generate new textures, but retrieves relevant ones from a curated or scraped CSV database and explains the choices using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that combines semantic search with language-based reasoning.
