# TextureBot
TextureBot is an intelligent assistant designed to support 3D artists in the process of selecting appropriate textures for their scenes. Rather than generating new textures, the system focuses on retrieving high-quality existing textures from a curated or scraped CSV database of online resources. Users interact with TextureBot through natural language descriptions, allowing them to express artistic or technical needs in an intuitive way.

The project is built around a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. First, a semantic search component analyzes the user’s request and identifies the most relevant textures within the structured dataset. Then, a large language model generates clear explanations and justifications for each selected texture, helping artists understand why a given texture fits their scene. By combining efficient retrieval with natural language reasoning, TextureBot aims to improve productivity, creativity, and decision-making in 3D texturing workflows.
